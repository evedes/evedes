## About

I build systems that solve real problems—and lead the teams that bring them to life.

Over the past 8+ years, I've worn many hats: frontend architect, team lead, CTO, and always a hands-on engineer. I've helped scale platforms serving 100M+ users, architected fintech applications from the ground up, and recently co-founded Zarta, an AI-powered SaaS platform that transforms how businesses document their knowledge.

What drives me? The intersection of great code and great teams. I believe the best solutions emerge when you combine solid technical architecture with clear communication, mentorship, and a bias toward shipping. Whether I'm refactoring a PostgreSQL schema, designing a component library, or implementing AI pipelines, I'm focused on creating value that lasts.

I work remote from Portugal and collaborate with teams across the US and Europe. Currently exploring opportunities where I can combine technical leadership with hands-on development—ideally in spaces where AI/ML meets real user needs.

Tech I love working with: React, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js Nest.js, Docker, CI/CD ops, PostgreSQL, AI/ML integrations (OpenAI, Anthropic), and anything that makes developers' lives easier.
